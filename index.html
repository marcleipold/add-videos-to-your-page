  <h1>Stage 0: Getting Started with HTML</h1>
  <h3>Introduction to the Web</h3>

  <div class="box">
    <h4>World Wide Web</h4>
    <div class="description">  
      <p>The web is a collection of html documents that are all linked together by Hyper Links.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
    <div class="description">  
      <p>HTML = Hyper Text Markup</p>
      <p>Everything online is made up of HTML.</p>
      <p>HTML is made up of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Text content (what you see)</li>
        <li>Markup (what it looks like)</li>
        <li>References to other documents (images, videos)</li>
        <li>Links</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>HTML Mark-up</b></p>
      <p>HTML consists of opening tags and closing tags, which make up an element.</p>

      HTML tags:
      <ul>
        <li>"em"= <em>italics</em></li>
        <li>"b"= <b>bold</b></li>
        <li>"p" = paragraph</li>
        <li>"h1" to "h6" = Defines HTML headings</li>
        <li>"div" = defines a section in a document</li>
        <li>"!DOCTYPE" = Defines the document type</li>
        <li>"br" = Defines a single line break</li>
        <li>"img" = Defines an image</li>
        <li>"a"= anchor (this is a link)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>HTML Attributes</b></p>
      <p>HTML attributes are listed after the elements, but before the corresponding value. 
        Links (a element) and images (img element) are self-closing and are considered Void tags beacuse they do not contain any content.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h4>More information...</h4>

    <div class="description">  
     <b>HTML Whitespaces</b>
     <p>Turns everything into one line. If we want to seperate the contents into multiple lines, 
       we write "br" which is a Void tag for "break". The "p" tag is also used and is not a Void 
       tag because it includes content.</p>

     <b>Inline and Block Elements</b>
     <p>These two types of elements are used to separate content. An example of
       an inline element is "br" because it adds a break in the content and places 
       the text on the next line below. 
       An example of a block element is "p" because it creates an invisible blox 
       around the content and also has a height and a width.
     Span is also an inline element and Div is a block element.</p>

     <b>Page Structure</b>
     <p>Websites are created like a house. The HTML is the structure, 
       the CSS is the styling or decor, and Javascript is the functional 
       parts or garage door.</p>

  <h1>Stage 1: Webpages, Documents, and Structure</h1>
  <h3>The Basics of the Web and HTML</h3>

 <div class="box">
   <h4>HTML, CSS, and DOM</h4>
   <div class="description">  
     <p><b>HTML</b> is the language of the web and includes syntax + rules.</p>

     <p><b>CSS</b> is a language that uses syntax + rules to change the way an 
       element looks on the page.</p>

     <p><b>Tags</b> are part of the lement that make up an HTML tree.</p>

     <p><b>DOM</b> ( Document Object Model) is what puts everything together. 
       The tree that we see in developer tools is the DOM tree that the browser 
       built from the HTML document.</p>

     <p>Each tag has an element that describes what type it is. An element consists 
       of a beginning tag, a closing tag, and everything in between.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h4>Boxes, Boxes, Boxes Everywhere</h4>
    <div class="description">  
      <p>Even if the shape is a circle, in HTML everything is made up of boxes. 
        If you want to right-click to inspect an element, you will see an 
        assortment of diffrent boxes.</p>

      <p>By thinking of things in boxes itâ€™s easier to rearrange your website. 
        A grid in background makes sure everything is aligned. When plotting 
        your squares and layout of HTML structure, remember: <b>START BIG AND
        GO SMALLER</b></p> 
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h4>Understanding CSS (aka Cascading Style Sheet)</h4>
    <div class="description">  
      <p>Now for some general laws...just like in our society; we have national
        laws, state laws, local municipality laws, and house rules. CSS has 
        laws/rules. The most specific ruleis applied to every element. Thus, our 
        "house laws" would be the same as our "national laws".</p>

      <p>Cascading means that rules are applied not only to the elements they 
        directly match but also to all of the elements' child elements. However, 
        if a child element has multiple overlapping rules defined for it, the more 
        specific rules apply.</p>

      <p>When using CSS it can be helpful to think about it as a Search-n-Replace 
        tool. You identify a "class" or "tag" of the element you want to match and 
        then what you want to do with, or what property values to replace with different 
        ones. Also, where and in what order matter. Styles can be defined in different 
        places and are applied in the following order, with definitions further down 
        `the list overwriting previous definitions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Default style of a browser (different browsers have slightly different styles)</li>
        <li>Stylesheet in a separate file (mostly used)</li>
        <li>Stylesheet inside a HTML (used for smaller projects, not ideal)</li>
        <li>Inline style in an element (should be avoided)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Inheritance:</b> relies on the ancestor/descendant relationship to operate. The idea by which properties are applied, not only to a specified element, but also it's descendants. It relies on the document tree, the hierarchy of HTML elements. Child elements may inherit CSS properties from any ancestor element enclosing it; they can also inherit text related properties, but box related properties are not inherited.</p>

      <p>Properties that can be inherited:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>color</li>
        <li>font</li>
        <li>letter spacing</li>
        <li>line height</li>
        <li>list style</li>
        <li>text align/indent</li>
        <li>text transform</li>
        <li>visibilty</li>
        <li>white space</li>
        <li>word spacing</li>
      </ul>

       <p>Properties that can't be inherited:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>background</li>
        <li>border</li>
        <li>display</li>
        <li>float & clear</li>
        <li>height & width</li>
        <li>margin</li>
        <li>min & max/ height & width</li>
        <li>outline</li>
        <li>overflow</li>
        <li>padding</li>
        <li>position</li>
        <li>text decoration</li>
        <li>vertical align</li>
        <li>z index</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>   

  <div class="box">
    <h4>Selectors</h4>
    <div class="description">  
      <p>Selectors are what allows you to targe specifc HTML elements and apply style to them. By doing this, you can condense your CSS to avoid unnecessary repetition, which waste time, and time is precious. It is recommended that CSS and HTML are kept in two different files, by keeping the design away from the document they are easier to edit. Selectors can be combined. Below is a list of different type of Selectors.</p>

      <p><b>ID Selectors</b><br>
      Most powerful type of selector, beat out other types of selectors and styles. Having lower specificity selectors are easier to override.</p>

      <p><b>Class Selectors</b><br>
      Most useful and versatile. Well supported in all browsers. Add multiple classes separated by space on HTML elements. Also JavaScript stuff you can do specifically for manipulating classes.</p>

      <p><b>Tag Selectors</b><br>
      Most useful when changing properties that are unique to HTML element. Like setting the list style on a "ul" or tab-size on a "pre". Typically more useful to have class define styling that you can use on any HTML element.</p>

      <p><b>Attribute Selector</b><br>
      More useful than classes because they have the same specificity value, but they can be any attribute, not just "class". They also can have a value you can select by.</p>

      <p><b>Positional Selectors</b><br>
      Several positional selectors beyond: nth-child; using simple expressions (like 3n="every third") you can select elements based on their position in the HTML.
      Other Pseudo Selectors
      ":empty" is one of many pseudo selectors, which you can recognize by the ":". They typically represent something you couldn't know just by the element and attributes alone. *These are different than pseudo elements, which are recognizable by "::"-they are responsible for adding things to the page by the things they select.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h4>Revisiting the BOX</h4>
    <div class="description">  
      <p>We know that everything on a webpage is made up of a box. Which consists of 4 parts:
      <ol>
        <li><u>Content-</u> this is the image or text that appears on the website, comparable to the nucleus of the box, the other layers serve to protect it so other things don't get to close or overlap</li>

        <li><u>Padding-</u> this clears an area around the content, is affected by background color, and is the space that protects the content directly</li>

        <li><u>Border-</u> inherits color property of box, incases the padding and content</li>

        <li><u>Margin-</u> goes around border, outer most layer, provides space between boxes, transparent</li>
      </ol>

      <p>To deal with sizing issues, use: "box-sizing:border-box...however...to make sure older browsers are able to display this CSS, you must add browser specific prefixes "webkit, moz, ms". If we set box size to percentage rather than pixels, the box sizing will adjust to size of screen. When positioning boxes remember: *divs are block elements so by default they take up the entire width of a page, to deal with this we can add the "display:flex" to appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other!* See this link for more information on FlexBox</p>
    </div>
  </div> 

  <div class="box">
  <h4>Code, Test, & Refine!</h4>
    <div class="description">  
      <p>Compare your code to the design you were given...	How to know what to change?</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Get page structure right, by visually boxifying it
          <ul>
            <li>Look for natural boxes</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Move on to tags(make heading h1)
          <ul>
            <li>Look for repeated styles & semantic elements</li>
          </ul>
            </li>
        <li>Size of boxes, how big, and how to position
          <ul>
            <li>Write html</li>
            <li>Apply styles(biggest to smallest)</li>
            <li>Fix things!</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
      </ol>

        A web crawler finds web pages for the search engine by starting a seed page and following links on that page to other pages, each of those, link to new web pages which can have new links to other pages.  As we follow the links we'll find more and more web pages building a collection of data that we'll use for our search engine.  A link is a special type of text in that web page.

        2 parts to screen: editor & output window
        We can see the value of something in Python by using print like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>print 3...</li>
        <li>prints out the value 3</li> 
      </ul>
      <p>
        The expression after the print can be any value Python expression. Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 + 1    addition</li>
        <li>2 - 1    subtraction</li>
        <li>2 * 6    multiplication</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We can compose expressions to make more complicated expressions like: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>52 * 3 +12 * 9</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We can also use parentheses to group expressions: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>(52 * 3) + (12 * 9)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        is different from
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>52 * (3 + 12) * 9</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example, this code prints out the the number of hours in a day: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>print 365 * 24 * 60 * 60</li>
      </ul>

    <h4>Language Ambiguity</h4>
     <div class="description">
      <p>
        Why write in Python instead of normal English?  
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Natural languages are ambiguous ( open to more than one interpretation- a computer will run programs with the meaning we intended, thus we must kow exactly what our programs mean)</li>
        <li>Natural languages are very verbose (wordy- to say something with the level of precision needed for a computer to be able to follow it mechanically would require an awful lot of writing)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Our goal in writing a program is for it to be short, so it is less work to write them, and easier to read and understand them.
      </p>
     </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h4>Grammar</h4>
     <div class="description">
      <p>
        Unlike a natural language, programming languages adhere to a strict grammatical structure.  In English, even if something is said or written incorrectly, it can still be understood with the help of context or other cues.  In programming, the code must match the language grammar exactly.  The Python interpreter has no idea what to do with input that is not in the Python language.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic English Grammar Rules:
          <ul>
            <li>sentence--subject, verb, noun</li>
            <li>subject--noun</li>
            <li>object--noun</li>
            <li>verb--eat</li>
            <li>verb--like</li>
            <li>noun--I</li>
            <li>noun--Python</li>
            <li>noun--cookies</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If programming grammar is not followed, the interpreter will return a syntax error; this means the structure of the code is inconsistent with the rules of the programming language.  Backus-Naur Form is used to describe a programming language in a simple and concise manner.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>&lt;non-terminal>-->replacement&gt;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The "replacement" can be any sequence of zero, more-terminals, or more non-terminals. Terminals never appear on the left side of a rule.  Once you get a terminal there is nothing else you can replace it with.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>sentence--subject verb noun</li>
        <li>sentence--noun verb object</li>
        <li>sentence--I verb object</li>
        <li>sentence--I like object</li>
        <li>sentence--I like noun</li>
        <li>sentence--I like Python</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the above example, the "I like Python" has been replaced with ALL terminals, therefore it can't be replaced anymore.
      </p>
     </div>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h4>Python Expressions</h4>
     <div class="description">
      <p>
        An expression is something that has a value.  Examples of expressions in Python:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>3</li>
        <li>1+1</li>
        <li>7*7*24*60</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One of the rules of Python grammar for making expressions:  Expression--&gt;Expression Operator Expression.  The Expression non-terminal on the left can be replaced by an Expression, followed by an Operator, followed by another Expression.  It can have an Expression on both the left and right sides; this may look circular, and would be except for other rules for Expressions that don't include Expression on the right.  This is an example of recursive definition (we'll see more in Unit 6).  To have good recursive definition, we need two rules:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A rule that defines something in terms of itself. (Expression--&gt;Expression Operator Expression)
        <li>A rule that defines that thing in terms of something else that we already know. (Expression--&gt;Number)
      </ol>
      <p>
        Recursive definitions are a powerful idea in Computer Science.  They allow us to define infinitely many things using a few simple rules.  More on that in Unit 6... Here are some Python grammar rules for arithmetic expressions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>expression--&gt;expression operator expression</li>
        <li>expression--&gt;number</li>
        <li>operator--&gt;+</li>
        <li>operator--&gt;*</li>
        <li>number--&gt;0,1,...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here is an example of derivation using this grammar:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expression--&gt;Expression Operator Expression
          <ul>
            <li>--&gt;Expression + Expression</li>
            <li>--&gt;Expression + Number</li>
            <li>--&gt;Expression + 1</li>
            <li>--&gt;Expression Operator Expression + 1</li>
            <li>--&gt;Number Operator Expression + 1</li>
            <li>--&gt;2 Operator Expression + 1</li>
            <li>--&gt;2 * Expression + 1</li>
            <li>--&gt;2 * Expression Operator Expression + 1</li>
            <li>--&gt;2 * Number Operator Expression + 1</li>
            <li>--&gt;2 * 3 Operator Expression + 1</li>
            <li>--&gt;2 * 3 * Expression + 1</li>
            <li>--&gt;2 * 3 * Number + 1</li>
            <li>--&gt;2 * 3 * 3 + 1</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We only have to add one more rule to our expression grammar to be able to produce all the expressions we have used so far: expression--&gt;(expression)
      </p>
     </div>
  </div><!--end of unit 4-->

  <h3>Unit 5: Variables and Strings</h3>

  <div class="box">
    <h4>Basics of Variables and Strings</h4>
     <div class="description">
      <p>
        Variables use an assignment statement, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>name=expression</li>
        <li>speed_of_light=299792458</li>
        <li>speed_of_light refers to value--&gt;299792458</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So we can use variables to reference values/data, instead of using an actual value.  Variables can...vary (crazy, right?) so we can update our expression.  Also there is no hard fast rule, but typically variables shouldn't be Capitalized.  It's important to remember that "=" is an assignment, it doesn't mean that the values are equal!
      </p>
      <p>
        Strings are a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes.  We can use single or double quotes.  The advantage to double quotes is that you can use single quotes inside of doube quotes.

        <li>so as not to say "hellodianna", add space after "hello "</li>

  <h3>Unit 9: Using Functions</h3>

  <div class="box">
    <h4>Let's...Take a Break</h4>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          In this lesson we write a Python program that reminds someone who works on a computer to take a break so many times per day; by playing a song on YouTube.  In this lesson we are introduced to <span class="italic">Modules</span>.  A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.  Another place we can visit to learn about built in modules in python is in the<a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/index.html">Python Standard Library</a>.

    <h4>Secret Messages...</h4>
      <div class="description"> 
        <p>
          The next program we wrote was a secret message to a loved one made up of scrambled images of letters.  We used a string function which can take up to 3 arguments; though we only use 2.  One of the arguments needed to be the items we wanted to remove from the file names so that they are unscrambled which will show the message!  When we refer back to the Python documentation for "string translate", it shows "string.translate(s,table[, deletechars])", since the lasst argument is in square brackets it indicates that it is optional.  Once we import the "string" module we use it by typing "file_name.translate(None,'012...").  Now...we put the "file_name" out front in place of the "string" module

  <h3>Unit 10: Using Classes</h3>

  <div class="box">
    <h4>Intro To Classes & A Few Turtles</h4>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          In lesson 2 of stage 3, we started to dip our feet in the topic of classes.  A <span class="italic">Class</span> is a blueprint that we use to build things.  We can also think of it as a logical grouping of data and functions.  A class is not actually anything in of itself, it describes how to make something.  From our original blueprint, or class, we are able to create lots of objects, or <span class="italic">instance</span>.  An individual instance will contain information/traits of what is in the class. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Some basic "class-lingo" we will touch on more later...
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>When we first <span class="italic">describe a class</span>, we are <span class="italic">defining</span> it (like w/ functions)</li>
          <li>The ability to group similar functions and variables toget her is called <span class="italic">encapsulation</span></li>
          <li>The word class can be used when describing the code where the class is defined and it can refer to an instance of that class</li>
          <li>A variable inside a class is known as an <span class="italic">attribute/instance variable</span></li>
          <li>A function inside a class in known as a <span class="italic">method/instance method</span></li>
          <li>A class is in the same category of things as variable, list, dictionaries, etc...meaning it is an <span class="italic">object</span></li>
          <li>A class is known as a <span class="italic">data structure</span>...meaning, it holds data and the methods to process that data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Python has built in functions, documentation on that can be found at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open">Python Standard Library</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a visual showing the connections with classes, objects/instances...

  <h3>Unit 11: Making Classes</h3>

  <div class="box">
    <h4>A Little How-To Guide & Some Vocab</h4>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          First thing we would want to do is think about what objects will be inside of the class and name it accordingly.  When we create or call a class, the function "init", which stands for initialize, is called and initializes or creates space in memory for our new instances.  It is also called a <span class="italic">constructor</span> because it constructs space in memory for the new instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is some additional vocab and examples of them.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Class</dt>
          <dd>class keyword allows us to make classes-a blueprint that can have data and methods</dd>
          <dt>Instance</dt>
          <dd>can be multiple instances of a class, when we create an instance the constructor gets called...</dd>
          <dt>Constructor</dt>
          <dd>this is the "init" method inside the class, it's here that we intialize all the data within the instance-uses the keyword self as itself or the instance in question</dd>
          <dt>Self</dt>
          <dd>is the self or instance in question (e.g. "toy story")</dd>
          <dt>Instance Variables</dt>
          <dd>all variables associated with an instance-these are unique to an object and can be accessed using the self keyword inside the class or instance name outside the class</dd>
          <dt>Instance Method</dt>
          <dd>functions inside the class that are associated with an instance and have the first argument as self</dd>
          <dt>Class Variables</dt>
          <dd>all classes come with predefined variables, such as "doc", "module", "name"...or we can define them ourselves inside of the class-but outside of the constructor.  Also class variables should be in all CAPS</dd>
          <dt>Inheritance</dt>
          <dd>an example of inheritance would be a parent child relationship, the child inherits the eye color and last name; but it could have it's own instance, such as number of toys</dd>
          <dt>Method Overriding</dt>
          <dd>when we create our own method that changes the implementation of a method provided by one of its parents</dd>
